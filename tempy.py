	This app performs simple webscraping and visualisation of wikipedia world population data . 
In 2018, the worldâ€™s population growth rate was 1.12%. Every five years since the 1970s, the population growth rate has continued to fall. The worldâ€™s population is expected to continue to grow larger but at a much slower pace. By 2030, the population will exceed 8 billion. In 2040, this number will grow to more than 9 billion. In 2055, the number will rise to over 10 billion, and another billion people wonâ€™t be added until near the end of the century. The current annual population growth estimates from the United Nations are in the millions - estimating that over 80 million new lives are added each year.
